# app4triqs - A skeleton for a TRIQS application

Initial Setup
-------------

To adapt this skeleton for a new TRIQS application, the following steps are necessary:

* Create a repository, e.g. https://github.com/username/appname

* Run the following commands in order after replacing **appname** accordingly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/triqs/app4triqs --branch unstable appname
cd appname
./share/squash_history.sh
./share/replace_and_rename.py appname
git add -A && git commit -m "Adjust app4triqs skeleton for appname"
```

You can now add your github repository and push to it

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/appname
git remote update
git push origin unstable
```

If you prefer to use the [SSH interface](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
to the remote repository, replace the http link with e.g. `git@github.com:username/appname`.

### Merging app4triqs skeleton updates ###

You can merge future changes to the app4triqs skeleton into your project with the following commands

```bash
git remote update
git merge app4triqs_remote/unstable -X ours -m "Merge latest app4triqs skeleton changes"
```

If you should encounter any conflicts resolve them and `git commit`.
Finally we repeat the replace and rename command from the initial setup.

```bash
./share/replace_and_rename.py appname
git commit --amend
```

Now you can compare against the previous commit with: 
```bash
git diff prev_git_hash
````

Getting Started
---------------

After setting up your application as described above you should customize the following files and directories
according to your needs (replace app4triqs in the following by the name of your application)

* Adjust or remove the `README.md` and `doc/ChangeLog.md` file
* In the `c++/app4triqs` subdirectory adjust the example files `app4triqs.hpp` and `app4triqs.cpp` or add your own source files.
* In the `test/c++` subdirectory adjust the example test `basic.cpp` or add your own tests.
* In the `python/app4triqs` subdirectory add your Python source files.
  Be sure to remove the `app4triqs_module_desc.py` file unless you want to generate a Python module from your C++ source code.
* In the `test/python` subdirectory adjust the example test `Basic.py` or add your own tests.
* Adjust any documentation examples given as `*.rst` files in the doc directory.
* Adjust the sphinx configuration in `doc/conf.py.in` as necessary.
* The build and install process is identical to the one outline [here](https://triqs.github.io/app4triqs/unstable/install.html).

### Optional ###
----------------

* If you want to wrap C++ classes and/or functions provided in the `c++/app4triqs/app4triqs.hpp` rerun the `c++2py` tool with
```bash
c++2py -r app4triqs_module_desc.py
```
* Add your email address to the bottom section of `Jenkinsfile` for Jenkins CI notification emails
