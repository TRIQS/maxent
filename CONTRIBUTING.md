# Contributing

Your contributions to the code are highly welcome.

Please, send them as a pull request to https://github.com/triqs/maxent/pulls.

Some things to consider:

- Please, document your code; depending on the nature of the contribution,
  just updating the reference (e.g., just by including doc comments) might
  be enough. Sometimes, writing a page in ``doc/guide`` is desirable.
- Please, test your code by writing a unit test to the ``test/python``
  directory.
- If your pull request adds a feature or something else that the users
  should be informed about, add a short line to the file ``doc/versions.rst``
  (in the section "Changes since the last version").
- Please, run ``autopep8`` on the python files.
  Remove all obviously ugly artefacts that this introduces.
- Include your name in the copyright notice in the header of
  the files you change.
- Include your name in the author list in ``README.md`` and ``doc/about.rst``.
