This application is a part of our scientific work and we would appreciate if
projects using it include a reference to the TRIQS/maxent github repo
until a dedicated software publication is available.

Should you use this package to perform analytic continuations of matrix-valued
functions we kindly ask you to cite our work [#maxent]_. Additionally,
we provide a :ref:`list<citations>` of relevant publications which you might
want to cite as well.

If you find the application useful, giving proper reference and citation is
indeed a simple way to help convincing funding sources that such projects are
useful for our community and should be supported.
